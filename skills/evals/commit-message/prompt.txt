Follow the commit-message skill guidelines from SKILL.md. Write a clear, well-structured commit message using the canonical format (not conventional commits).

Requirements:
- Subject line ≤ 50 characters, no ending period
- Blank line after subject
- Body wrapped at 72 characters
- Lead with most important information (pyramid structure)
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Appropriate detail level for change complexity
- Self-contained (understandable without external resources)

Output only the commit message, nothing else.
