1. **Structure** (0-2 points)
   - Subject line ≤ 50 chars, no period
   - Blank line after subject
   - Body wrapped at 72 chars

2. **Clarity** (0-3 points)
   - Most important info first (pyramid)
   - Clear state changes (before/now)
   - Self-contained (no external deps)

3. **Completeness** (0-3 points)
   - Explains "why" not just "what"
   - Includes rationale when non-obvious
   - Mentions side effects if significant

4. **Detail Balance** (0-2 points)
   - Appropriate detail for change complexity
   - Avoids over-documentation of obvious changes
   - No unnecessary "Test Plan" or "Changes:" lists
